  abstract = {Can the governmental efforts to promote a common language break through linguistic barriers for migrants? We provide a ``yes-and-no'' answer. We argue that a political promotion of a single common language increases (potential) migrants' willingness to integrate into a new community but only works when the individuals' proficiency of that language can pass a threshold.  Nevertheless, we also predict such governmental effort is unable to erase the concern of linguistic barriers, given language as not only a communication tool but also an identity marker. People still prefer to migrate to the area where they are more familiar with the vernacular, even after taking their proficiency in the common language into account. We support our hypotheses with a nationally representative survey of over 2,000 migrants and a survey experiments over 1,000 adults with a mixture of migrants and non-migrants. Both the survey respondents and experiment subjects were recruited from China, a country promoting a single official language for 60 years. The results are robust after controlling for individuals' economic demands, regional effects, locally political restrictions, and other alternative factors. These findings shed light on the linguistic factor in the migration dynamics and the influence of governmental efforts on it.},
