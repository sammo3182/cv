  abstract  = {How does the context of income inequality in which people live affect
	their belief in meritocracy, the ability to get ahead through hard
	work? A prominent recent study by Newman, Johnston, and Lown argues
	that, consistent with the conflict theory, exposure to higher levels
	of local income inequality leads lower-income people to become more
	likely to reject{\textemdash}and higher-income people to become more
	likely to accept{\textemdash}the dominant United States ideology
	of meritocracy. Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported
	by the study{\textquoteright}s own reported results and that even
	these results depend on pooling three distinctly different measures
	of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis
	of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent
	measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion.
	Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower
	incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with
	more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing
	to work hard.},
