  abstract = {Cultural diplomacy has become an important component of modern day diplomacy. The distinctive characteristics and functions of cultural diplomacy also attract scholarly attention. Although scholars attempt to understand cultural diplomacy from various angles, some questions remain unanswered. For example, do cultural diplomacies differ due to different cultures? If so, which aspect of the cultural diplomatic difference relates to the cultural difference? Are there other important factors, other than culture, influencing cultural diplomatic practices between states? Essentially, questions, such as the aforementioned three, consider two linked issues. The first issue questions the differences in cultural diplomacy among different states. The second question ponders the relationship between the differences as it affects cultural differences between states. This thesis intends to investigate the two issues through a comparative study of Canadian and Chinese cultural diplomacies. The analyses will compare and contrast four main aspects of cultural diplomacies of two states, i.e. institutional setting, cultural strategy, diplomatic practice, and phasic result. The thesis argues that, despite some common ground in cultural diplomacy by different states, some obvious and culture-related differences do exist. Distinctive institutional settings, contents of cultural strategies, or different practical means and channels in cultural diplomacy may relate to their cultural characteristics. The thesis also argues that the factors influencing the characteristics of a state's cultural diplomacy are complex. Non-cultural factors also exert an impact, and in some cases, are more significant than cultural factors. This study should deepen our understanding of cultural diplomatic differences among states, and more importantly, form an extensive connection between the distinctiveness of the culture of a state and its cultural diplomacy. Therefore, this thesis emphasizes the necessity to pay adequate attention to the influence of a culture's distinctive characteristics upon cultural diplomacy, which is often overlooked in existing cultural diplomacy studies. Additionally, different states have some common cultural diplomacy features and are affected by the effects of non-cultural factors. This also indicates the cultural diplomatic characteristics of a state are influenced by multiple factors. Thus, the thesis may lay a foundation based upon which to take a comprehensive view of cultural diplomacy in general.},

  abstract = {Authoritarian governments talk about democracy frequently. Why do they do so? What does the term democracy mean in an authoritarian political language? This research uses a computer-assisted text analytical approach illustrating how an authoritarian government strategically manipulates the discourse about democracy to benefit itself. By analysing over a million political articles published in People's Daily over five decades, the study shows a refocusing framing strategy, in which the Chinese government defines democracy not with regime justification but with national policy priorities while denoting democracy most frequently alongside the fundamental values. With this strategy, the framed discourse appear to be consistent with the fundamental values in Western democracies but work for the preservation of the authoritarian regime.},

  abstract = {Is public trust in government representatives (i.e., bureaucrats, police, public servants) affected by the language they use? The conventional theory holds that, in a multilingual society, people favor government representatives who speak the listeners' dialects because it indicates a shared cultural identity, that is, the ``culture-marker'' effect. This article offers an alternative mechanism in which people's attitudes can be affected by the government designating the official language as a marker of political authority. Listeners will then project their respect for the political authority to the government representatives who speak this marker language. This mechanism is named an ``authority marker'' effect. Using a set of adjusted matched-guise experiments in China, this study examines the culture-marker and authority-marker effects. The results support the authority-marker effect by showing that listeners have significantly more trust in the bureaucrats who speak the official language than in those who speak the dialects of the listeners. The study also finds that this is a unique effect for speakers when they represent the government. Without that political identity, listeners will still respond more positively to speakers of their own dialects.},

  abstract = {How does the context of income inequality in which people live affect their belief in meritocracy, the ability to get ahead through hard work? A prominent recent study by Newman, Johnston, and Lown argues that, consistent with the conflict theory, exposure to higher levels of local income inequality leads lower-income people to become more likely to reject\textemdash{}and higher-income people to become more likely to accept\textemdash{}the dominant United States ideology of meritocracy. Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the studys own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three distinctly different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.},
