  abstract = {In this article, we argue that citizens' personal exposure to corrupt transactions with bureaucrats, many of whom are the only representatives of the state these people encounter, leads to a conclusion that the political leadership is corrupt and, therefore, undeserving of electoral support. To provide empirical support for this thesis, we first justify our case for analysis by discussing the significance of voting in authoritarian systems. While scholars have explained the function of semi-competitive elections in non-democratic systems, few have actually studied how citizens make their electoral choices in such contexts. We fill this gap by validating a "demobilization" model of voting in competitive authoritarian regimes. We show that even though voting in such systems is unlikely to bring about regime change, citizens do use elections to express their political preferences and their opinions about the performance of their leaders. Most significant is our identification of two causal paths by which individual contact with corrupt officials undermines Vladimir Putin's electoral support. Our demobilization model also specifies the nuanced mechanisms, both direct and indirect, by which other well-established predictors affect turnout and vote choice in an authoritarian context.},

  abstract = {Cultural diplomacy has become an important component of modern day diplomacy. The distinctive characteristics and functions of cultural diplomacy also attract scholarly attention. Although scholars attempt to understand cultural diplomacy from various angles, some questions remain unanswered. For example, do cultural diplomacies differ due to different cultures? If so, which aspect of the cultural diplomatic difference relates to the cultural difference? Are there other important factors, other than culture, influencing cultural diplomatic practices between states? Essentially, questions, such as the aforementioned three, consider two linked issues. The first issue questions the differences in cultural diplomacy among different states. The second question ponders the relationship between the differences as it affects cultural differences between states. This thesis intends to investigate the two issues through a comparative study of Canadian and Chinese cultural diplomacies. The analyses will compare and contrast four main aspects of cultural diplomacies of two states, i.e. institutional setting, cultural strategy, diplomatic practice, and phasic result. The thesis argues that, despite some common ground in cultural diplomacy by different states, some obvious and culture-related differences do exist. Distinctive institutional settings, contents of cultural strategies, or different practical means and channels in cultural diplomacy may relate to their cultural characteristics. The thesis also argues that the factors influencing the characteristics of a state's cultural diplomacy are complex. Non-cultural factors also exert an impact, and in some cases, are more significant than cultural factors. This study should deepen our understanding of cultural diplomatic differences among states, and more importantly, form an extensive connection between the distinctiveness of the culture of a state and its cultural diplomacy. Therefore, this thesis emphasizes the necessity to pay adequate attention to the influence of a culture's distinctive characteristics upon cultural diplomacy, which is often overlooked in existing cultural diplomacy studies. Additionally, different states have some common cultural diplomacy features and are affected by the effects of non-cultural factors. This also indicates the cultural diplomatic characteristics of a state are influenced by multiple factors. Thus, the thesis may lay a foundation based upon which to take a comprehensive view of cultural diplomacy in general.},

  abstract = {My dissertation explores how authoritarian governments use language policy to impact public political trust. Based on a comprehensive examination through survey analyses, experiments, and large-scale text analyses, my research demonstrates that authoritarian governments, such as in China, can use language policy as a political tool to influence citizens' political attitudes. In particular, language policy empowers the official language used by government representatives, such as street-level bureaucrats, reinforcing their political identities and enhancing citizens' trust in them. Using an original randomized experiment in China based on a new sociolinguistic technique, my research finds robust evidence that listeners hold significantly more trust in bureaucrats who speak the official language than in those who speak dialects, even if the respondent and government representative share the same dialect. Furthermore, my research shows that language not only influences citizens' political trust but also their understanding of political concepts. Using a computer-assisted text analysis of over one million articles from the official newspaper of the dominant party of China from 1946-2003, I indicate a refocusing strategy by which the official discourse about democracy manipulates the meaning of democracy in the Chinese political language without contradicting with the Western democratic values, while simultaneously preserving the authoritarian regime. Drawing on multiple waves of nationally representative surveys from China, my dissertation also identifies distinctive effects of improving listening, speaking, and relative proficiencies of Putonghua on Chinese citizens' political interest, efficacy, pursuit, and institutional-based political trust. This study contributes to political science, and even the entire social science by justifying the important role of language in human social and political lives and turning the research focus from language content to language context.},

However, the empirical research on this area is underdeveloped and relies on small and potentially biased samples. Method. This study collects unique spatial-opinion data of over 300 such informal education facilities in China merged with original survey data and conducts a systematic evaluation of this form of propaganda. Result. The statistical results challenge the conventional expectation that more exposure to the informal education facilities would improve the citizens' support and obedience to the government. Conclusion. The findings reveal a backfire effect of informal education facilities that more exposure to them reduces both citizens' political support and obedience.},

The conventional theory holds that, in a multilingual society, people favor government representatives who speak the listeners' dialects because it indicates a shared cultural identity, that is, the ``culture-marker'' effect. This article offers an alternative mechanism in which people's attitudes can be affected by the government designating the official language as a marker of political authority. Listeners will then project their respect for the political authority to the government representatives who speak this marker language. This mechanism is named an ``authority marker'' effect. Using a set of adjusted matched-guise experiments in China, this study examines the culture-marker and authority-marker effects. The results support the authority-marker effect by showing that listeners have significantly more trust in the bureaucrats who speak the official language than in those who speak the dialects of the listeners. The study also finds that this is a unique effect for speakers when they represent the government. Without that political identity, listeners will still respond more positively to speakers of their own dialects.},

In this article we contend that when individuals are proficient in a foreign language\textemdash e.g. a lingua franca\textemdash they have an alternative channel through which they are exposed to positive narratives put forth by other parties regarding the former aggressor state. And as a result, their attitudes towards the former aggressor state are more positive than those held by their linguistically limited counterparts. To test our argument, we focus on public attitudes towards the Japanese in Mainland China, Singapore, and Taiwan\textemdash three Chinese-ethnic majority political units that experienced Japanese aggression leading up to and during World War II. Using survey data, we demonstrate that individuals who are proficient in the English language are much more likely to hold positive attitudes of the Japanese. These results are robust even when we consider whether some individuals are predisposed to being cosmopolitan; whether some individuals have more opportunities to learn English; and whether the linguistic effects are symptomatic of American soft power.},

  abstract = {Why do migrants choose some destinations over others? This study explores the influence of language and language policy on migrant preferences. Governments can use language policies to help reduce communication barriers for migrants but mother tongue still signals identity differences. We argue that migrants prefer to move to regions where the difference in vernacular languages is smaller because of both communicative and cultural considerations. We examined these arguments with survey experiments and econometric analyses of national representative data from China. Our study finds that differences in native languages influence migration decisions, even when there is a widely-spoken common national language. The findings support our argument even after controlling for economic and institutional factors, and uncovers a non-linear effect of proficiency in the language promoted by government policy. The findings have far-reaching implications for understanding the migration decision-making process and the role of language policy in shaping national integration and population dynamics. A common national language can help migrants communicate and therefore remain in their migration destinations, but does not eliminate the role of mother tongue and local vernacular identity and integration. Even in a country where the government has promoted a single common language for six decades, local language diversity still matters.},

We further examine the motivations driving viewers to watch the program, finding that external factors, such as media inequality, historical inertia, and family bundling, do not greatly alter people's watching behavior. Instead, internal motivations, such as the pursuit of authentic information and psychological gratification, significantly increase the frequency at which viewers watch XWLB.

We find that strict limits on local hukou status do not deter migrants. However, local hukou status is important because it confers access to public benefits. When migrants can gain access to public services without changing their hukou status, cities are more appealing.

We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.},
